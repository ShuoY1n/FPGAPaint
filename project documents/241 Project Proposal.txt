Summary
:
 
The
 
idea
 
of
 
your
 
project
 
summarized
 
in
 
1-3
 
sentences.
 
 
Drawing
 
simulation
 
-
 
the
 
brushstrokes
 
will
 
be
 
motion
 
detected
 
with
 
an
 
accelerometer
 
and
 
gyroscope
 
(when
 
switch
 
is
 
on
 
for
 
drawing),
 
and
 
then
 
displayed
 
on
 
the
 
monitor.
 
By
 
using
 
other
 
switches,
 
different
 
colors
 
can
 
be
 
selected
 
to
 
paint
 
with.
 
With
 
the
 
push
 
of
 
a
 
button
 
(KEY),
 
the
 
drawing
 
can
 
be
 
converted
 
into
 
sound
 
that
 
will
 
play
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
placements
 
and
 
color
 
of
 
the
 
ink.
 
 
Block
 
Diagram
:
 
A
 
simple,
 
high-level
 
block
 
diagram
 
of
 
the
 
hardware
 
showing
 
the
 
datapath,
 
the
 
inputs,
 
and
 
the
 
outputs.
 
 
 
 
Project
 
Schedule:
 
A
 
schedule
 
of
 
what
 
will
 
get
 
done
 
on
 
a
 
week-by-week
 
basis.
 
This
 
must
 
include
 
what
 
you
 
both
 
will
 
prepare
 
as
 
Milestones
 
for
 
your
 
project
 
(see
 
below).
 
Try
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
schedule
 
realistic;
 
set
 
realistic
 
deadlines
 
and
 
include
 
dedicated
 
time
 
to
 
debug
 
the
 
project
 
at
 
the
 
end.
 
We
 
recommend
 
breaking
 
the
 
problem
 
into
 
manageable
 
pieces;
 
such
 
that
 
at
 
any
 
point
 
you
 
will
 
have
 
something
 
to
 
present
 
by
 
the
 
Project
 
Presentation.
 
In
 
the
 
real
 
world,
 
things
 
go
 
wrong
 
all
 

the
 
time.
 
You
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
most
 
of
 
a
 
bad
 
situation.
 
You
 
must
 
get
 
something
 
working
 
by
 
the
 
presentation.

Division
 
of
 
Work:
 
The
 
division
 
of
 
tasks
 
between
 
each
 
team
 
member.
 
Each
 
member
 
must
 
state
 
the
 
components
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
taking
 
responsibility
 
for.
 
The
 
division
 
of
 
work
 
must
 
be
 
fairly
 
distributed
 
(each
 
student
 
doing
 
at
 
least
 
1.5
 
labs
 
worth
 
of
 
work).
 
Work
 
must
 
be
 
divided
 
between
 
each
 
member
 
for
 
each
 
milestone
 
(all
 
members
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
do
 
work
 
each
 
week).
 
Each
 
student
 
will
 
be
 
held
 
to
 
this
 
division
 
of
 
work.
 
If
 
work
 
is
 
unfairly
 
distributed
 
for
 
the
 
Milestones
 
or
 
Presentation,
 
marks
 
will
 
be
 
adjusted
 
accordingly.
